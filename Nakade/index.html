                <p>Nakade is a real-time generative graphical music visualisation created for the <a style="color: #56d4fa" href="https://synchrony.nyc/">Synchrony</a> 2020 New-York-Montréal demoscene event, where it was awarded first place in the demo category.</p>
                <p>"Nakade" is a double entendre between Bulgarian and Japanese. "Na kade" (на къде) in Bulgarian means "where to?", in a way posing the question "where can I find home?". In Japanese, "naka de" (中で) translates to "inside", answering the question is "home is found inside oneself".</p>

                <p>This project was created in collaboration with Victor Ivanov (<a style="color: #56d4fa" href="https://v-os.ca">v-os.ca</a>), who composed, sound designed and mixed the music heard in the demo, and provided key insights into game logic design and photogrammetric model creation.</p>
                <p>My contribution consists in the development of custom shader and graphics programs that allowed us to shear, twist and distort space in real time, and melt point clouds into flowing, liquid-like patterns.</p>
                <p>All of the scenes showcased in the demo were created through photogrammetry, allowing us to transform real-world spaces into 3D environments made of colored points. Most scenes were captured in New-York, but two scenes were captured on the train on which the demoscene event occured, just a few hours before the final version of the program was compiled.</p>
                <p>For an optimal viewing experience, you can download the <a style="color: #56d4fa" href="https://v-os.ca/media/downloads/nakade/nakade_windows.zip">Windows</a> or <a style="color: #56d4fa" href="https://v-os.ca/media/downloads/nakade/nakade.app.zip">macOS</a> executable to run Nakade on your machine. Video compression does not allow a good reconstruction of this pointillistic visual style, especially at high resolutions. Nakade was optimized to run at 4K 30FPS on a high-end laptop.</p>
