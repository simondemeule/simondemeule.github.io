                <p>What Lies Ahead is an interactive poetic experience that explores themes of artificial intelligence, language, human psychology, and artistic intent.</p>
                <p>Through a simple text-based interface, this piece creates a dialog between its participant and a text generating AI, a version of the GPT-2 language transformer model trained on the Gutenberg corpus, a collection of approximately 60000 pieces of English literature. Every response of the participant is mirrored by the AI, which tries to complete the text as if it was written by a single author. Responses gradually develop as they are being generated in real time by the AI; each atomic element which constitutes it cascades through all configurations considered by the algorithm, allowing the participant to catch a glimpse of the inner workings of its interlocutor. The asymmetry of this conversation makes it all the more interesting; collaborating with a writer that lacks intent fundamentally changes how the participant interprets the text and guides its evolution throughout the piece. Despite a lack of intent, meanings emerge â€” the human tendencies captured by the algorithm resurface, sometimes distorted, absurd, or familiar.</p>
                <p>The creation of What Lies Ahead was made possible by the <a style="color: rgb(228, 49, 18)" href="https://www.convergenceinitiative.org/about-us-int">Convergence Initiative</a>, an organisation which aims to create interdisciplinary collaboration between arts and science. This piece is the product of my work and that of Pauline Palma, a poet and neuroscientist dedicated to language research who wrote the introductory poem and helped shape the piece into a meaningful experience, linking it to themes of agency, expectation, and psychology of language.</p>
                <p>The piece has notably been selected to be shown at <a style="color: rgb(228, 49, 18)" href="https://www.mozillafestival.org/fr/">Mozilla Festival</a> 2021, and been showcased at <a style="color: rgb(228, 49, 18)" href="https://launchlab.ai/">AI Launch Lab</a>'s January 2021 Hackathon, where Simon was invited to speak on the implications and possibilities of AI and art.</p>
                <p>This piece is occasionally made available on <a style="color: rgb(228, 49, 18)" href="http://whatliesahead.io">whatliesahead.io</a>, although it is not hosted at all times. Please get in touch with me if you would like to experience it.</p>
