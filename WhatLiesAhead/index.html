                <p>What Lies Ahead is an interactive poetic experience that explores themes of artificial intelligence, language, human psychology, and artistic intent. </p>
                <p>Through a simple text-based interface, this piece creates a dialog between its participant and a text generating AI, a version of the GPT-2 language transformer model trained on the Guthenberg corpus, a collection of approximately 60000 English texts. Every response of the participant is mirrored by the AI, which tries to complete the text as if it was written by a single author. Response gradually develop as they are being generated in real time by the AI; each atomic element which constitutes it cascades through all configurations considered by the algorithm, allowing the participant to catch a glimpse of the inner workings of its interlocutor. The asymmetry of this conversation makes it all the more interesting; collaborating with a writer that lacks intent fundamentally changes how the participant interprets the text and guides its evolution throughout the piece.</p>
                <p>The creation of What Lies Ahead was made possible by the <a style="color: #56d4fa" href="https://www.convergenceinitiative.org/about-us-int">Convergence Initiative</a>, an organisation which aims to create interdisciplinary collaboration between arts and science. This piece is the product of my work and that of Pauline Pamal, a poet and neuroscientist dedicated to language research.</p>
                <p>This piece is ocasionally made avaliable on <a style="color: #56d4fa" href="http://whatliesahead.io">whatliesahead.io</a>, although it is not hosted at all times. Please get in touch with me if you would like to experience it.</p>
