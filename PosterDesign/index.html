                <p>In this recent project (2017) I set out to create two posters for a fictional gig — one which I hope to make real one day. The intent was to communicate what it was efficiently (along with where it would be and when) — a large part of what expresses the genre of music the gig belongs to — electronic music — is simply the chosen aesthetic; angular features, saturated and contrasting colors, abstraction, geometric figures, glitch-like patterns, and contemporary typefaces. </p>
                <p>In this first poster, I played with gradient fills to make lines clearly stand out without using strokes. One could certainly say this style has roots in futurism. I proceeded by creating the geometry and gradients in Illustrator, also drawing the type elements by hand. I then added subtle color spreading effects in Blender.</p>

                <p>In this second poster, I went with a more usual grid-based approach, using the QR-like pattern as a basis. The 3D polyhedron rain was created using Blender using a particle system, simple custom shaders, and some depth-of-field compositing. The QR pattern was also created using Blender particle systems. Finally, everything was brought together in Illustrator, where type based elements were added. Two complementary fonts were chosen; a geometric sans serif in two weights, and a slab serif sharing a similar geometric character, it's thick slabs working in tandem with the square elements of the pixelated background.
